Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems.

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning. Topics include: \(i\) Supervised learning \(parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks\). \(ii\) Unsupervised learning \(clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning\). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots \(perception, control\), text understanding \(web search, anti-spam\), computer vision, medical informatics, stock market analysis, and other areas.
